# FullStack_WebBaseComplete_Authentication_FoodOrdering_Application
This is Full-Stack Base Web Application. In this use Authentication for security purpose build with Cookie and Session This is fully try to provide full security in this. This is use Mongodb database and Nodejs for backend.


<h2>🔐 Secrets Web Application </h2>

A secure web application that allows users to register, log in, and safely store their secrets.
This project demonstrates best practices for authentication, password security, and session management for beginners learning backend development.

<h2>📌 Project Objective </h2>

The Secrets Web App is built to demonstrate strong authentication and security measures.
It provides a secure environment where users can confidently share and manage their secrets while ensuring:
